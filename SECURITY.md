When reporting, please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept
- The impact and severity
- Any relevant logs or code

You will receive a response **within 48 hours**, and a fix will be rolled out **within 7‚Äì14 days** depending on severity.

## üîê Security Best Practices We Follow

- Automatic dependency auditing (`npm audit`, `pip-audit`)
- HTTPS enforced for all external calls
- Input sanitization and validation
- Access control logic and permission checks
- No use of `eval`, raw `innerHTML`, or unsanitized inputs
- Environment variables for secrets (`.env` pattern)
- Regularly updated `.gitignore` and secure `.env` handling
- Separate dev and production configs

---

## ‚úÖ Scope of Vulnerability Reports

We welcome reports related to:

- Sensitive data leaks (tokens, emails, user data)
- Broken access control or privilege escalation
- XSS, CSRF, SQLi, or any form of code injection
- Insecure API endpoints
- Unsafe use of libraries or dependencies

Out of scope:

- Denial of service (DoS) through valid input
- Reports from outdated dependencies with no usage in core logic
- Self-XSS without a real-world impact
